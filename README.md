# Ames Housing Dataset

If you ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, they might not start with the basement ceiling height or the distance to a railroad. However, this playground competition's dataset proves that numerous factors influence price negotiations beyond the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.

With a whopping 79 explanatory variables covering almost every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges participants to predict the final price of each home.

## Practice Skills
- Creative feature engineering
- Advanced regression techniques like random forest and gradient boosting

## Acknowledgments
The Ames Housing dataset was curated by Dean De Cock for data science education. It serves as an excellent alternative for data scientists seeking a modernized and expanded version of the often-cited Boston Housing dataset.

## Evaluation
### Goal
Your task is to predict the sales price for each house. For each ID in the test set, participants must predict the value of the SalePrice variable.

### Metric
Submissions are evaluated based on the Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE) between the logarithm of the predicted value and the logarithm of the observed sales price. This approach ensures that errors in predicting expensive houses and cheap houses have an equal impact on the result.
